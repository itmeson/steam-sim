Background
----------

How do you measure speed in your car?  Miles per hour, right?  Well the word
"per" implies a division -- so if you drive 80 miles in 2 hours, you must have
been driving 40 miles per hour (on average).  This suggests a basic relation
between speed, distance and time:  $$SPEED = \\frac{DISTANCE}{TIME}$$
